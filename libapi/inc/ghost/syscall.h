 * Clobber flags (more: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html):
 * - The "cc" clobber indicates that the assembler code modifies the FLAGS register
 * - The "memory" clobber tells the compiler that the assembly code performs memory reads
 *   or writes to items other than those listed in the input and output operands. Causes
 *   GCC to assume that anything in memory could have changed (the system call could do so).
