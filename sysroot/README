Welcome to the Ghost OS!

This is the terminal. It allows you to navigate through the filesystem and
execute programs and commands. Typing 'help' will give you the list of built-in
terminal commands.

The '/applications' folder contains some programs to try out.

Tip: The ramdisk filesystem is writable. To write stuff into a file,
pipe it into the 'write' program.
'echo Hello! | write test.txt'

Have fun! :-)
